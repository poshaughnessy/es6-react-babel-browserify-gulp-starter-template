# ES6 Starter Template

This is a simple little starting template for an ES6 project, using:

 * React
 * Babel
 * Browserify
 * Babelify
 * Sass
 * Gulp

## Instructions

Just type `gulp` to compile and run up the server - then fire up `localhost:8000` in the browser.

Please note: only the front-end code is ES6 right now. The server isn't, because I'm waiting for
Gulp v0.4. When that's released, I'll update `gulpfile.js` and `server.js` and and change the
start script to add [the harmony flags](https://github.com/heroku-examples/node-harmony-example).

Feel free to fork, copy or use however you like.

## Why no Yeoman Generator?

I don't really use Yeoman, but if it would be useful for anyone, I could try making a Generator for this.
Just let me know. Or feel free to go for it yourself!
