# Starter Template for ES6 + React + Babel + Browserify + Gulp

This is a simple little starting template for an ES6 project, using:

 * React
 * Babel
 * Browserify
 * Babelify
 * Sass
 * Gulp

## Instructions

Just type `gulp` to compile and run up the server - then fire up `localhost:8000` in the browser.

Feel free to fork, copy or use however you like.

## Why no Yeoman Generator?

I don't really use Yeoman, but if anyone would like me to, I could try making a Generator for this.
Just let me know. Or feel free to go for it yourself!
