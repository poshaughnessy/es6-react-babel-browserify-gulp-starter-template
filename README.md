# ES6 (EcmaScript 2015) Starter Template

This is a simple little starting template for an ES6 (a.k.a. EcmaScript 2015) project, using:

 * React
 * Babel
 * Browserify
 * Babelify
 * Sass
 * Gulp
 * Node
 * Express

## Instructions

Just type `gulp` to compile and run up the server - then fire up `localhost:8000` in the browser.

Feel free to fork, copy or use however you like.

## Why no Yeoman Generator?

I don't really use Yeoman, but if it would be useful for anyone, I could try making a Generator for this.
Just let me know. Or feel free to go for it yourself!
