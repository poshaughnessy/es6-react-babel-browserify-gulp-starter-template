# ES6 React Starter Template

This is a simple little starting template for an ES6 (a.k.a. EcmaScript 2015) project, using:

 * React
 * Babel
 * Browserify
 * Babelify
 * Sass
 * Gulp
 * Node
 * Express

## Instructions

Just do `npm install` and type `gulp` to compile and run up the server. Then load up `localhost:8000` in the browser.

Gulp will watch for JS and SCSS changes and recompile, but it won't live-reload (I just prefer to Cmd+R).

Feel free to fork, copy or use however you like.

## After an isomorphic version?

See: [es6-react-isomorphic-starter-template](https://github.com/poshaughnessy/es6-react-isomorphic-starter-template).

## Why no Yeoman Generator?

I don't really use Yeoman, but if it would be useful for anyone, I could try making a Generator for this.
Just let me know. Or feel free to go for it yourself!
