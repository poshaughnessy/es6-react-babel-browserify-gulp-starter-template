# ES6 React Starter Template

This is a simple little starting template for an ES6 (a.k.a. EcmaScript 2015) project, using:

 * React
 * Babel
 * Browserify
 * Babelify
 * Sass
 * Gulp
 * Node
 * Express

## Instructions

Just do `npm install` and type `gulp` to compile and run up the server. Then load up `localhost:8000` in the browser.

Gulp will watch for JS and SCSS changes and recompile, but it won't live-reload (I just prefer to Cmd+R).
